# Music, Web Monetized

Proof of concept.
https://dist.wietse.now.sh

Please note: this repo doesn't contain the MP3 files with the correct ID3 tags (copyright ;)).

You'll need these files:

```
	src/assets/1.mp3
	src/assets/2.mp3
	src/assets/3.mp3
	src/assets/4.mp3
```

Containing a payment pointer in the `comment` ID3 tag.
